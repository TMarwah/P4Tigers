# What is our project?
Our project is going to be a website that sells merchandise to the user, much like Amazon, eBay, or any other online
shop.

# What will the website feature?
- Login system that allows user to create accounts
- Clothing options, such as sweaters and shoes that the user can purchase https://github.com/TMarwah/P4Tigers/blob/main/templates/index.html
- Options for users with accounts to set default addresses and card information
- Having a database that tracks what certain users buy
- Having a Checkout Feature
- Adding items to a cart and having the program save those items in the cart
- Navbar with Bootstrap that will contain different tabs for the site https://github.com/TMarwah/P4Tigers/blob/main/templates/base.html

# Completed Web Tickets
-successfully used HTML code to program the shop homepage, along with the index and resolution tabs; currently 
ready to deploy on Raspberry Pi in Scrum Board. Next step is to start creating items for purchase and add cart management features.
- folder containing HTML: https://github.com/TMarwah/P4Tigers/tree/main/templates
- Integrated shop site: https://github.com/TMarwah/P4Tigers/blob/main/templates/index.html
- Can be evaluated via runtime by using the home navbar to visit the shop homepage and seeing the successfully integrated HTML.

-successfully integrated the home page as well as adding a navbar using Bootstrap that contains different tabs of possible items; currently ready to deploy
on Raspberry Pi in Scrum Board
- file containing Bootstrap: https://github.com/TMarwah/P4Tigers/blob/main/templates/base.html
- Can be evaluated via runtime by running the project and checking if the navbar does lead to the different tabs on our website.

-successfully made a completed about us page with visuals and bootstrap buttons to scroll through the team, as well as a carousel on the bottom in which individual slides can be picked by the viewer; currently ready to deploy.
- file containing bootstrap and visual code: https://github.com/TMarwah/P4Tigers/blob/main/templates/testmonial.html
- Can be evaluated via runtime by checking if the bootstrap carousel and buttons successfully scroll through the different profiles in the about us page.
