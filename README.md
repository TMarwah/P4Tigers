# What is our project?
Our project is going to be a website that sells merchandise to the user, much like Amazon, eBay, or any other online
shop.

# What will the website feature?
- Login system that allows user to create accounts
- Clothing options, such as sweaters and shoes that the user can purchase
- Options for users with accounts to set default addresses and card information
- Having a database that tracks what certain users buy
- Having a Checkout Feature
- Adding items to a cart and having the program save those items in the cart
- Navbar with Bootstrap that will contain different items that can be bought
# Assignments
To be decided as of December 11th, 2020.
