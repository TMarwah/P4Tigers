# What is our project?
Our project is going to be an online shopping center, much like what Amazon and eBay are. It will contain various types
of merchandise, mainly clothing that ranges from sweaters to shoes. It will be able to log the users information on the
website, including search and purchase history.

# What will this website feature?
- Login system that allows people to create accounts
- Selections of clothing that range from sweatshirts to shoes
- Options that allow the user to set defaults, such as addresses and card info

# Assignments
To be decided as of 12/11
